# Contributing

Thanks for taking an interest in helping to develop [bujo](https://github.com/dcchambers/bujo)!

Bujo is in the early stages of development right now and is not yet ready for outside code contributions. Please consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/dcchambers/bujo/issues/new) with a feature request, or browse the [development docs on the wiki](https://github.com/dcchambers/bujo/wiki).

Project planning is being done in the new GitHub Projects.
